## Warning

This mod is NOT compatable with a mod that changes the announcers voice of a character since this could create conflicting audio files (edit the audio file that comes with this mod if you have a seperate announcer voice file).

This mod is NOT compatable in a multiplayer environment unless the other player(s) also have this mod installed.

We are NOT responsible for what happens to your Nintendo account! Please take precautions!

# Troubleshooting

*Is the game not starting?*
- Try clearing out other mods that you believe may be conflicting with this mod

*Does this work with Ryujinx?*
- Ryujinx is a little different as their mod folder is located within %appdata% --> sdcard --> atmosphere --> contents --> 01006a800016e000 --> romfs --> skyline --> (drag .nro files into here). Our mod is already simplified so that all you need to do is go into: %appdata% --> sdcard. While in the sdcard folder, drag and drop the mod files in. Be sure to install the required file listed above!

*If there's other issues*
- Please check the latest release descriptions. If your issue is not mentioned in those descriptions, please do NOT open up an issue on this GitHub page as this mod is done developing. Instead post a comment on the [GameBanana Page](https://gamebanana.com/mods/457095) (chances are we will not respond as we're done with Smash modding but other people may respond), and/or go to Ultimate Modding Discord server and state your issue there.
