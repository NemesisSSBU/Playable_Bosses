## Setup
Make sure you have a modded Switch or emulator, atmosphere, and ARCropolis.

## Requirements
[ARCropolis](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/releases)

[Skyline](https://github.com/skyline-dev/skyline/releases)

[NRO Hook](https://github.com/ultimate-research/nro-hook-plugin/releases)

[ACMD Hook](https://github.com/ultimate-research/acmd_hook/releases)
```
Make sure you have a modded Switch or emulator, atmosphere, and ARCropolis (don't worry, this comes packaged with the mod).

*Step 1*

- Unpack the .zip release file

*Step 2*

- Drag and drop the unpacked files ("atmosphere" and "ultimate") into the root of your Switch SD card

*Step 3*

Go to the requirements section and install ARCropolis, Skyline, NRO Hook, and ACMD Hook. Drag and drop those files within the plugins folder. This can be located at: sdcard --> atmosphere --> contents --> 01006A800016E000 --> romfs --> skyline --> plugins

*Step 4*

- Start the game and you should be good to go!
```
## Warning

This mod is NOT compatable with a mod that changes the announcers voice of a character since this could create conflicting audio files (edit the audio file that comes with this mod if you have a seperate announcer voice file).

This mod is NOT compatable in a multiplayer environment unless the other player(s) also have this mod installed.

We are NOT responsible for what happens to your Nintendo account! Please take precautions!

# Troubleshooting

*Is the game not starting?*
- Try clearing out other mods that you believe may be conflicting with this mod

*Does this work with Ryujinx?*
- Ryujinx is a little different as their mod folder is located within %appdata% --> sdcard --> atmosphere --> contents --> 01006a800016e000 --> romfs --> skyline --> (drag .nro files into here). Our mod is already simplified so that all you need to do is go into: %appdata% --> sdcard. While in the sdcard folder, drag and drop the mod files in, if you installed skyline previously it'll ask to replace some files so that's up to you whether or not you want to replace your previous ARCropolis folder or not with the one that comes prepackaged within our mod. Once it's dragged in you're ready to go!

*If there's other issues*
- Please check the latest release descriptions. If your issue is not mentioned in those descriptions, open up a "New Issue" in the issues tab on GitHub and describe the issue to the best of your ability.
